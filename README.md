A turn-by-turn combat RPG video game with a tactical twist, developed in Python.

Developed for a school project, we were a group of 3 and I ended up coding and designing every aspect of the game. One of the group members just gave me a hand for balancing weapons and armors.

The project was developed in Python. There is a full guide in PDF format available in the game files. 

The features I like the most are probably the modular items design (anyone can add an item to the game via the editor, which is a separate program) and the save/load progress system.

Stuff to add whenever I can : 
- Add poison/bleed damage system 
- Rebalance enemies, improve AI
- Add a character leveling system
- Store the player progression in a single file instead of two
- Add a gear improvement system with runes, smithing upgrades, etc.
